Is my virtual environment setting up correctly? Can we walk through this together?

When is the command 'finally' most useful?

For the assert command - is this essentially creating our own error messages?

Is there a way to use git from the command line without entering my password each time I push to git hub? 

How could I make fizz buzz keep asking for a number a certain number of times until it just says 'sorry, come back later?'

In assignment one of lesson 5, it gives me the option to clone a git link - how can I do this?

Is there a way to copy and paste in the command line?
