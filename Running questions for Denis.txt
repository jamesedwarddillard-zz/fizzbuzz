Running questions for Denis

Things to talk about during our next conversation:

Is my virtual environment setting up correctly? Can we walk through this together?

When is the command 'finally' most useful?

For the assert command - is this essentially creating our own error messages?

Is there a way to use git from the command line without entering my password each time I push to git hub?
